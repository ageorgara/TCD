Detection of luminous controller via web camera in Raspberry Pi B+

In this project we perform image processing using the library OpenCV and an implementation of Label algorithm.
We identify a source of colored (or not) light per frame, we calculate the movement made by the source and transmit it through network in order to be passed as input in games.
